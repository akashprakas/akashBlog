    "### 1. Not able to detect small objects properly. \n",
    "    Usually all the new object detection networks use some kind of Feature Pyramind to detect the object across differenet scales. In DETR we cannot use that because the self attention if across the entire feature map and this could lead to a computational explotion .Deformable Detr tends to solve this problem by attending to features from feature maps of different levels.\n",
    "###  2. Too much training time.\n",
    "    This is because the network needs to learn the actually features to attend to from the full feature map and this will take a good time to converge to. Deformable detr solves introducing a Deformable Attention module , that doesnt look into all the keys , but only a subset of them. \n"
