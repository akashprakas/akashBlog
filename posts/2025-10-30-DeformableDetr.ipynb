    "This blog provides a code-level walkthrough of the internals of Deformable DETR and its core component—deformable attention—to understand how it works in practice. I’ll explore the full pipeline: starting from how a batch of images flows through the convolutional backbone, then into the encoder, and finally how deformable attention operates within the architecture both in encoder side and decoder cross attention. Along the way, I’ll highlight where Deformable DETR aligns with the original DETR and where it diverges.\n",

    "## Why was Deformable DETR needed?\n",
    "[Deformable DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04159) is an enhancement of DETR, which was one of the first approaches to apply transformers to object detection. While DETR introduced a novel paradigm, it faced two major challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Difficulty Detecting Small Objects\n",
    "Most modern object detection networks leverage Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) to handle objects at multiple scales. However, DETR cannot easily incorporate FPN because its global self-attention operates over the entire feature map, making multi-scale attention computationally expensive.\n",
    "Deformable DETR addresses this by introducing multi-scale deformable attention, which selectively attends to a small set of key points across different feature levels instead of the entire map. This enables efficient multi-scale feature aggregation without exploding computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Long Training Time\n",
    "DETR requires extensive training because the model must learn which parts of the feature map to attend to from scratch, which is slow to converge.\n",
    "Deformable DETR solves this by using a Deformable Attention Module, which focuses on a sparse set of relevant keys rather than all possible keys. This reduces complexity and accelerates convergence significantly.\n"
